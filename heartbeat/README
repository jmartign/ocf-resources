The resource agent scripts in the heartbeat/ source directory originated from the
Linux-HA project, available at http://www.linux-ha.org .  Local changes to the
scripts prohibit their installation into the "heartbeat" OCF provider subdir -
so they get installed to the "joekhoobyar" OCF provider subdir just like the
scripts in the joekhoobyar/ source directory.
